# Breakdown RL
Simple sci-fi roguelike, based on Jotaf's "Complete Roguelike Tutorial, using python+libtcod" article

Article, that can be found here:

#Requirements: 

Python2.7 and SDL. More about technical issues can be found in the first part of Jotaf's article.

Tested on Ubuntu 16.04, but also should work on Windows.

It is intended to be my first project, written in Python, so it serves to me as a good way of language learning and it is NOT a serious project.

#Story background:

Science fiction setting has been chosen with all its hi-tech, robots, laser weapons and stuff.

"You are the member of the lunar mining station's service staff. Your workplace lies deep beneath the surface of the Moon, on the lowest station levels.
One day something gone terribly wrong and countless robot workers that inhabit the station gone mad. Getting to the surface is the only way to survive the breakdown."

This is just the starting point. Story will be worked out later.

#Controls:

Numpad keys - movement and melee attack

'i' - open inventory

'p' - pick up items

'd' - drop items

'f' - shoot

Ctrl + Enter - toggle fullscreen

ESC - open main menu

Game is not even close to be completed. For now, winning condition is absent.

To run the game simply run main.py in Python interpreter
